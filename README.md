## Overview 🎯

I created this webpage as one of my submissions to the Responsive Web Design course by freeCodeCamp. For the layout inspiration, I referrred to the example provided by freeCodeCamp for that assignment. For the product idea, I used one of my future project ideas. The problems and the management troubles I'm facing, right now, as a college student inspired me to design a seriously powerful classroom management software. However, I'm still working on building the skills required to build such software. So, I tried to express my idea through this landing page.

## My Process 📝

I clearly knew the product that I'm going to build this landing page. I quickly realized that I had the idea of a wonderful classroom management software but, I never gave it a thought deep enough! I never thought of what it would contain! So, I spent a while to brainstorm about what will my imaginary software have. I reffered to the user stories and the example project provided by freeCodeCamp. So, planned the following sections for my site:

- A Hero Section
- Features Section
- A "How it works" section
- Pricing Section
- A "Get Started" Section

With the idea in mind, inspired by the design of the example porject by freeCodeCamp, I created a wireframe for my website.

Before started coding, the creative department of my brain insisted me to create a company logo, and a demo screenshot of the software. So, I immediately pulled up my Canva and started looking for designs that might match my idea. After a few minutes of disappointment, I decided to create my own. I always wanted to go to Hogwartz so, I used it as my idea for the design. Hence the name, "Hogwartz"! I quickly created the company logo with a castle icon, and a very simple demo screenshot of my software.

Now that I had all of my resources and the wireframe ready, I didn't take me long to finish coding. I always thought CSS is the one that takes up most of the time but, it was the brainstorming and devising the entire idea of the webite that actually takes more time than coding.

For the design, I used flexbox in all of the sections the align the crads in the features and the pricing setions, content in the hr=ero section, and the social icons in the footer. As for the HTML, most the code uses HTML5 tags, and almost every element is written with the pretty much the same tag that comes to  your mind when you look at the page. And I also created a navigation bar that always sticks to the top (used FlexBox for this one too).

### Built with 🛠️

- HTML (or you could say HTML5, to be version specific)
- CSS (used a lot pof FlexBox)
- Canva (for the icon, and the demo screenshhot)

### What I Learned 🗒️

This project taught me the importance of the amount of creativity one needs to put in to work on something original. And on the tech side, it felt more like a FlexBox drill. I had fun making this project.
